I'm an ECE student at Princeton interested in energy systems modeling, ML-driven infrastructure, and hardware-software systems.

## What I work on
- Digital hardware design & verification (Verilog, SVA)
- Backend ML pipelines (Python, PyTorch, Julia/JuMP, R)
- Energy systems & infrastructure modeling

## Featured Projects

### **LSTM Forecasting Model for Energy Demand in PJM Grid (Julia, JuMP)**
Built an end-to-end extension to a Macro-scale energy systems software platform, creating an LSTM that generates multi-scenario demand inputs for MacroEnergy MILP optimization. Please refer to the extensions/pjm_forecasting section for my addition.

### **16-bit Stored-Program Processor (Verilog, Xilinx FPGA)**
Custom-designed CPU with a full ISA, RTL implementation, and FPGA deployment.
