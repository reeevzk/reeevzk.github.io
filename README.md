# Hi, I'm Reva

I'm an ECE student at Princeton interested in energy systems modeling, ML-driven infrastructure, and hardware-software systems.

# What I work on
- Digital hardware design & verification (Verilog, SVA)
- Backend ML pipelines (Python, PyTorch, Julia/JuMP)
- Energy systems & infrastructure modeling

## Featured Projects

### 16-bit Stored-Program Processor (SystemVerilog, FPGA)
Custom-designed CPU with a full ISA, RTL implementation, and FPGA deployment.


### Genomics ML: Drought Tolerance Modeling
Machine learning pipeline for genotype–phenotype association using GWAS-style models.
